## iGaming - online shop follows gamers needs

The project was created by Express.js without any frontend frameworks. The design is minimalistic using Bootstrap. The priority is architecture and understanding of technologies, not UI.

Display categories </br>
Display all products within one category </br>

Add items to cart </br>
Payment simulation </br>

### Tech Stack

Express.js — Backend framework for Node.js </br>
Supabase (PostgreSQL) — Database for products and users </br>
Bootstrap — Minimalist, responsive UI </br>
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) — Render dynamic HTML pages </br>
Render — Deployment platform </br>

### Project Focus
This project is not about a fancy UI — it’s about understanding architecture, data handling, and backend logic.
All products and users are stored in Supabase, fetched via SQL queries, and rendered on the server side.

### Deployment
The project is deployed on Render (free plan), so it may take a few seconds to wake up.
Be patient 😉
