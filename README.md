The project was created by Express.js without any frontend frameworks. The design is minimalistic using Bootstrap. The priority is architecture and understanding of technologies, not UI.

Key features:  
Registration & authorization  
Display categories  
Display all products of one category  
Display similar products  
Adding items to cart  
Payment (simulation)  
Order history  
Bilingual content (English / Spanish)  

All products and users are stored in Supabase, SQL requests to get data, SSR to render HTML files, Bootstrap for UI, Render for deployment.

P.S. I used the free deployment version, so it will take some time to render the project. Be patient ;)

The project was created by Express.js without any frontend frameworks. The design is minimalistic using Bootstrap. The priority is architecture and understanding of technologies, not UI.

### Core Features

Registration & authorization
Display categories
Display all products within one category
Display similar products
Add items to cart
Payment simulation
Order history
Bilingual content (English / Spanish)

### Tech Stack

Express.js — Backend framework for Node.js
Supabase (PostgreSQL) — Database for products and users
Bootstrap — Minimalist, responsive UI
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) — Render dynamic HTML pages
Render — Deployment platform

### Project Focus
This project is not about a fancy UI — it’s about understanding architecture, data handling, and backend logic.
All products and users are stored in Supabase, fetched via SQL queries, and rendered on the server side.

### Deployment
The project is deployed on Render (free plan), so it may take a few seconds to wake up.
Be patient 😉
