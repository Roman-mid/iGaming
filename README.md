The project was created by Express.js without any frontend frameworks. The design is minimalistic using Bootstrap. The priority is architecture and understanding of technologies, not UI.

Key features:  
Registration & authorization  
Display categories  
Display all products of one category  
Display similar products  
Adding items to cart  
Payment (simulation)  
Order history  
Bilingual content (English / Spanish)  

All products and users are stored in Supabase, SQL requests to get data, SSR to render HTML files, Bootstrap for UI, Render for deployment.

P.S. I used the free deployment version, so it will take some time to render the project. Be patient ;)
